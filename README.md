# Smart Gesture-Based Interaction System

## 📌 Overview
This project enables **gesture-based control** for smart devices and virtual input mechanisms using **Mediapipe, OpenCV, and IoT**. It provides a touchless experience for interacting with digital systems, making it ideal for smart homes, AR/VR, and automation.

## 🚀 Features
- **Virtual Input** – Gesture-based keyboard and calculator.
- **IoT Control** – Manage smart devices using hand gestures.
- **Real-Time Processing** – Optimized for low latency and high accuracy.
- **Multi-User Support** – Handles multiple gestures simultaneously.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Mediapipe** (for hand tracking)
- **OpenCV** (for computer vision processing)
- **IoT Integration** (Raspberry Pi/Arduino)
- **Machine Learning** (for gesture classification)

## 📂 Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/shivam15112003/Smart-Gesture-Based-Interaction-System.git
   cd Smart-Gesture-Based-Interaction-System
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the gesture recognition system:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- AI-based adaptive learning for personalized gestures.
- Expanded IoT support for more smart home devices.
- Improved gesture recognition under low-light conditions.
